            Equipment makes up the backbone of your loadout, which means it&apos;s also the most
            complex section of the loadout builder! If you selected a loadout preset after choosing
            a ship, it will appear here. Read on for more information about this section!
            <br />
            <span className='yellow'>Veteran pilots:</span> You can expect a similar experience to
            the ingame equipment system. Just note that you can select the quantity of an equipped
            Secondary Weapon or Consumable to change it.
            <br /><br />
            The amount of available equipment tiles depends on the amount of slots allocated by the 
            currently selected ship. If either the Ancient Weapon or Splitter enhancements are 
            installed, the amount of Primary or Secondary Weapons slots are modified accordingly. 
            Each equipment tile can be controlled using the buttons in their upper-right corner:
            <br /><br />
            <SVGIcons.AddEquipIcon height='1.3vw' /> - Adds a new piece of equipment to an empty
            tile. Equipment will be added exactly in the specified tile, and will remain there even
            if an empty tile is above it.
            <br />
            <SVGIcons.AddModIcon height='1.3vw' /> - Adds a new modification to an existing piece
            of equipment, if it is eligible. You can install up to three mods per equip (or four,
            if you are using the Colonial Sentinel). Installed mods are listed above the
            equipment&apos;s stats. Modding is irreversible, unless the equipment is removed and
            replaced.
            <br />
            <SVGIcons.RemoveEquipIcon height='1.3vw' /> - Removes a piece of equipment from the 
            loadout, as well as its installed mods & enhancements where applicable. If you have 
            equipped the <span className='yellow'>Ancient Weapon</span>, you must uninstall the 
            enhancement in order to remove it here.
            <br /><br />
            Selecting an occupied equipment tile will display it&apos;s information here. Selecting
            an empty tile will allow you to see these instructions again.
            <br /><br />
            <span className='yellow'>Eligible Primary Weapons & Devices</span> can be enhanced by
            selecting the button that will appear above its description. Doing so opens a popup,
            where you will be prompted to set the stats that changed with the enhancement. 
            Enhancement is irreversible, unless the equipment is removed and replaced.
            <br /><br />
            <span className='yellow'>Secondary Weapons & Consumables</span> all have their own
            quantity indicators, which appear in the upper-left hand corner of their respective
            tiles. Selecting that indicator will open a popup allowing you to change it at will.
            These quantities can be modified at any time, and will all persist after the loadout 
            has been submitted.
            <br /><br />
            <span className='yellow'>In order to submit your loadout,</span> it must have at least
            one equipped Primary or Secondary Weapon, and must have received a unique name. You can 
            change the loadout&apos;s name by selecting the &quot;Loadout Name Here&quot; box next
            to the page title.
