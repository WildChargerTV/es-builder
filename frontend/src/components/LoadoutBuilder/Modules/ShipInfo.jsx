            magic happens. If you know your way around EVERSPACEâ„¢ already, this should (hopefully)
            be easy to navigate; but if not, these infoboxes will provide some instructions for
            you!
            <br /><br />
            To begin, select one of the four ships on the left to equip it to your loadout, and 
            it&apos;s information & stats will appear here. You are allowed to change your ship at 
            any time until the loadout is submitted, at which point it will no longer be editable.
            <br /><br />
            Once you&apos;ve chosen a ship, you&apos;ll be able to choose whether to start your
            loadout from scratch, or select one of the loadout presets provided to you by the game.
            Upon selecting your desired option, the Enhancements & Equipment tabs will become
            available!
