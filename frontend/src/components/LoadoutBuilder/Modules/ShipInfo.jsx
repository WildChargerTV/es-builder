            <span className='yellow'>Notes for Testers: </span>
            ESBuilder currently ignores any aspect of player progression, as it is currently 
            considered out-of-scope. Until further notice, assume that you have the Encounters DLC,
            and that you have unlocked all possible preset loadouts & maximized all perks on all
            ships.
            <br /><br />
            It is currently a known issue that ship & equipment stats only display as numbers, and 
            do not have any units of measurement alongside them. Currently, the intent is that on
            release, applicable ship stats will be influenced by installed equipment, and equipment
            stats will be influenced by installed mods. Creating these interactions will take a LOT
            of time, and is being saved for later in favor of fleshing out core functionality.
            <br /><br />
            Please feel free to report any other issues you may encounter with the Loadout Builder.
